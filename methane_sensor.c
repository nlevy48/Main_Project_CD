/* Using a MQ-4 Sensor with Arduino to detect Methane (CH4) gas levels in the air */

/* MQ-4 sensors detect the presence of methane gas (CH4) in the air. This code establishes a connection between an MQ-4 sensor and an Arduino
and prints out an analog output to the serial monitor. The analog signal that is generated and printed is proportional to the amount of gas detected in the air. 
The code also establishes a routine for a digital output. When digital output is HIGH (representing a high amount of gas detected), this triggers a red LED light to illuminate. */

const int AO_Pin=0; // Connect the AO of MQ-4 sensor with analog channel 0 pin (A0) of Arduino

// Set up

Serial.begin(115200);  // Initialize serial monitor using a baud rate of 115200

Serial.print("Methane Conentration: "); // Print out the text "Methane Concentration: "
Serial.println(AO_Out); // Print out the methane value - the analog output - beteewn 0 and 1023
